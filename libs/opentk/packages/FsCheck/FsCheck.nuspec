    <description>FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically. The programmer provides
a specification of the program, in the form of properties which functions, methods
or objects should satisfy, and FsCheck then tests that the properties hold in a
large number of randomly generated cases.

While writing the properties, you are actually writing a testable specification of your program.

Specifications are expressed in F#, C# or VB, using combinators defined
in the FsCheck library. FsCheck provides combinators to define properties,
observe the distribution of test data, and define test data generators.
When a property fails, FsCheck automatically displays a minimal counter example.</description>
    <summary>FsCheck is a tool for testing .NET programs automatically using randomly generated test cases.</summary>
    <releaseNotes>Fix bug in function generator - previously generated functions were constant functions.
Add ThrowingFunction and Arb.Default.ThrowingFunction which generates a pure function, but that also throws exceptions.
Add Gen.shuffle which generates random permutations of a given input sequence.
Improvements and new features for FsCheck.Experimental.StateMachine: allow tracking of results of operations through the OperationResult type. The implicit
dependencies encoded by one operation using the result of another, are taken into account by the shrinker.</releaseNotes>
